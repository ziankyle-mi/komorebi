# Design Review Workflow

A structured process for evaluating UI designs against quality, consistency, accessibility, and usability standards.

---

## Review Rubric (Score 1–10)

Score every design across these six dimensions. Each dimension contributes to the overall quality score.

| # | Dimension | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Visual Hierarchy** | 20% | Clear focal points, scannable layout, meaningful contrast between elements, proper heading structure |
| 2 | **Consistency** | 20% | Token adherence, component reuse, pattern consistency across pages, naming conventions |
| 3 | **Accessibility** | 20% | WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, target sizes |
| 4 | **Usability** | 20% | Task efficiency, learnability, error prevention, cognitive load, clear affordances |
| 5 | **Responsiveness** | 10% | Mobile-first, breakpoint behavior, touch targets, content reflow, no horizontal scroll at 320px |
| 6 | **Performance** | 10% | Image optimization, animation efficiency, perceived loading speed, skeleton states |

**Scoring Guide:**
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9–10 | Exemplary — ready to ship, reference-quality |
| 7–8 | Good — minor polish needed |
| 5–6 | Adequate — several issues to address before shipping |
| 3–4 | Below standard — significant rework needed |
| 1–2 | Critical — fundamental problems, back to drawing board |

**Overall Score Formula:**
```
Overall = (Hierarchy × 0.2) + (Consistency × 0.2) + (Accessibility × 0.2)
        + (Usability × 0.2) + (Responsiveness × 0.1) + (Performance × 0.1)
```

## Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

Evaluate the design against each heuristic. Flag violations.

| # | Heuristic | What to Check |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Visibility of System Status** | Loading indicators, progress bars, current state indicators, selected states |
| 2 | **Match Between System & Real World** | Natural language, familiar icons, logical ordering, cultural conventions |
| 3 | **User Control & Freedom** | Undo/redo, cancel, back navigation, easy exit from flows, dismiss modals |
| 4 | **Consistency & Standards** | Platform conventions followed, internal consistency, component reuse |
| 5 | **Error Prevention** | Confirmations for destructive actions, constraints, disabled invalid options |
| 6 | **Recognition Over Recall** | Visible options, contextual help, recent items, search suggestions |
| 7 | **Flexibility & Efficiency** | Keyboard shortcuts, power user features, customizable views |
| 8 | **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design** | No unnecessary elements, clear visual weight, purposeful use of space |
| 9 | **Help Users Recognize & Recover from Errors** | Clear error messages, suggestions, inline validation, recovery paths |
| 10 | **Help & Documentation** | Onboarding, tooltips, help center, contextual guidance |

## Review Process

### Step 1: Context Gathering
Before reviewing, understand:
- **User**: Who is the target user? What is their technical level?
- **Goal**: What task is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Context**: Where does this screen fit in the user journey?
- **Constraints**: Technical limitations, brand guidelines, timeline

### Step 2: First Impression (30 seconds)
Without interacting:
- What draws your eye first? Is it the right thing?
- Can you tell what the page is for?
- Does it feel cluttered or balanced?
- Is the primary action obvious?

### Step 3: Task Walkthrough
Walk through the primary user task:
- Can you complete the task without instructions?
- How many steps does it take?
- Are there dead ends or confusion points?
- What happens with errors?

### Step 4: Systematic Check
Review against:
- [ ] **Token Compliance** — Are colors, typography, spacing from the token system?
- [ ] **Component Library** — Are standard components used correctly?
- [ ] **Accessibility** — Run through `accessibility/wcag-checklist.md` P0 items
- [ ] **Responsive** — Check mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints
- [ ] **States** — Empty, loading, error, populated, overflow, edge cases
- [ ] **Content** — Real-ish content (not just "Lorem ipsum"), edge cases (long names, empty fields)

### Step 5: Document Findings

## Output Format: Findings Table

Prioritize every finding by severity:

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Blocks users, a11y violation (P0), data loss risk | Must fix before launch |
| **Major** | Significant UX degradation, inconsistency across flows | Fix in current sprint |
| **Minor** | Small polish issues, non-blocking inconsistencies | Fix when convenient |
| **Enhancement** | Improvement ideas, not bugs | Add to backlog |

**Findings Table Template:**

| # | Severity | Category | Location | Finding | Recommendation | Heuristic |
|---|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | Critical | A11y | Login form | Error messages only use red color | Add error icon + text description | — |
| 2 | Major | Usability | Dashboard | No empty state for new users | Add onboarding empty state with CTA | H6 |
| 3 | Minor | Consistency | Settings | Save button alignment differs from other forms | Right-align to match pattern | H4 |
| 4 | Enhancement | Efficiency | Data table | No keyboard shortcuts for bulk actions | Add Shift+Click for range select | H7 |

## Design Audit Process (Existing Products)

For auditing an existing product (not a new design):

### 1. Inventory
- Screenshot every unique screen
- Catalog all unique components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- Document all color values, font sizes, spacing values in use

### 2. Gap Analysis
Compare inventory against design system tokens:
- **Off-token colors**: hex values not in `tokens/colors.json`
- **Off-token typography**: font sizes/weights not in `tokens/typography.json`
- **Off-token spacing**: padding/margin values not on the 4px grid
- **Inconsistent components**: same concept, different implementations

### 3. Severity Mapping
Map every gap to a severity:
- **Critical**: Accessibility violations (contrast, target size, keyboard)
- **Major**: Inconsistencies that confuse users
- **Minor**: Visual polish (1px off, slightly wrong shade)
- **Enhancement**: Opportunities to improve

### 4. Remediation Roadmap
Group findings into actionable batches:
1. **Quick wins** — Token swaps, contrast fixes (< 1 hour each)
2. **Component standardization** — Replace one-offs with system components
3. **Layout refactors** — Grid alignment, responsive fixes
4. **New patterns** — Missing states, new components needed

## Review Checklist (Quick Reference)

```
□ Visual hierarchy — clear focal point and scanning path
□ Typography — heading levels correct, body text readable
□ Color — sufficient contrast, not only means of information
□ Spacing — consistent rhythm, breathing room
□ Alignment — grid-aligned, no visual drift
□ Components — using established patterns correctly
□ States — all 6 states defined for interactive elements
□ Empty states — meaningful illustration + CTA
□ Loading — skeleton or spinner for async content
□ Errors — clear, actionable, accessible error messages
□ Responsive — mobile, tablet, desktop considered
□ Touch targets — 24px minimum (48px recommended)
□ Focus indicators — visible on all interactive elements
□ Keyboard — full flow completable without mouse
□ Screen reader — meaningful landmarks, labels, live regions
□ Motion — animations serve purpose, respect prefers-reduced-motion
□ Content — real content, edge cases (long strings, empty, overflow)
□ Dark mode — if supported, tested thoroughly
